Minting and Uploading Ticket
For this process user need to upload and verify upload from the terminal. Creating assets and metadata for the NFTs can be found on "Metaplex Readme File".

**Process for miniting NFTs Token after connecting wallet**
  - Clone metaplex file outside app folder.

    git clone https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex.git ~/metaplex

  * Terminal Code: 
    - yarn install --cwd ~/metaplex/js/
    - solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
    - solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
    - solana config set --url devnet
    - ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts --version
    - solana config get
    - solana airdrop 2
    - solana balance

    - Create assets folder outside app folder. Creating metadata for the assets can be found on Metaplex documentation. 
    - Inside metadata json update your address with phantom wallet address.
    - Create config file in root folder. Config file can be obtained from Metaplex folder in github. In solTresauryAccount: Add your solana wallet address. It can be obtained from using "solana address" in terminal.
    - Inside config number, it should be the amount of NFTs you are minting. If you are minting 1 NFT use 1 if 2 use 2 and so on.

**Environment setup for Candy machine**
    - Edit the .env file presented in the folder.
    - Update Candy Machine ID. ID can be found on .cache/devnet-temp

  * Upload and verify your NFTs
    - ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts verify_assets "./assets"(path of assets. Do not use "")
    
    - ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json
    "./assets"(path of assets (do not use "")) 

    - ts-node ~/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts verify_upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json 

    - There should be a message "Ready to deploy"

    - Refresh the web page and Mint the NFTs. Approve in the wallet. You can see the uploaded NFTs in phatom wallet collectibles.


Troubleshoot:
•	NPM not correctly installed (Depends on situation Update/remove and install/add addtional dependency)
•	Uploading assets might fail (Make sure the images and metadata are in the same folder and the phantom wallet address is correct and make sure you have Sol Balance)
•	Minting Ticket fail (Make sure you have your phantom wallet on devnet and the goLiveDate on the config file is set to the time you’re minting)
